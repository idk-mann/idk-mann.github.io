                        <p>Born in Kuching, currently 20, I’ve spent the past two and something years diving into the world of programming. I have experience working with several programming languages, including Python, C, C#, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I completed my secondary studies with a GCE O-level certificate and I am currently in my second year of my Computer Science degree. One of my hobby are working with electronics especially small electronics projects such as attempting to fix broken electronics, modding keyboard or mouse.</p>

                                <h4 class="project-subtitle"><strong>What I’ve Learned:</strong></h3>
                                <p>
                                    BlueSkies helped me strengthen my understanding of asynchronous programming, clean architecture, REST API integration, and advanced UI design in Android. It was a valuable learning experience, particularly in applying <span class="highlight">MVVM architecture, Kotlin Coroutines, and WorkManager for reliable background processing</span>. I gained valuable backend experience by building features like personalized notifications and time-aware theming, which allowed me to deliver a more dynamic and user-focused experience.

                            <p class="project-description reveal-from-top">I followed a YouTube tutorial to recreate a Street Fighter-like game using JavaScript and the HTML Canvas element. This is because I want to learn from experienced developers, adopting best practices. However, I’m taking the project further by adding custom features, such as a blocking where the player takes less damage. As for the project, all of the fighter hit and hurt animations are complete. However, I acknowledge that the game is not fully polished yet, as there are hitboxes and keybinding that are still off, along with other small details.</p>

                            <h3 class="project-title reveal-from-left"><strong>- Pixel Battleship</strong></h3>

                            <p class="project-description reveal-from-top ">Pixel Battleship is a recreation of the classic Battleship game using JavaScript and WebSocket, albeit with a pixified look that adds a retro, pixel art style to the gameplay. I've learned a lot, especially how to structure and organize the code. There's also logic that allows the computer to search for the ship if a hit is detected. There's additional CSS and JavaScript animations for the ship waves and hit effect.</p>

                            <p class="project-description reveal-from-top">CRYPTO is a flask application that I made to learn about JavaScript, Bootstrap and handling APIs response using restful CoinMarketCap basic plan API. CRYPTO has a main table to display all the relevant data about the crypto currencies, when a row is clicked a more detailed page is shown. A treemap made with D3.js offers data visualization of the cryptocurrency. </p>

                            <p class="project-description reveal-from-top">Due to the constraints of the free plan, this project has limited API enpoints to work with. Unfortunately, historical data endpoints are not accessible, which means the ability to generate price graphs using API calls is not feasible. Sort functions done thru the API parameters are questionable at best. </p>
